# WiMAX-fuzzy-scheduling

WiMAX is a wireless communication standard designed for Wireless Metropolitan Area Networks to provide up to 75 megabits-per-second data rate. The IEEE 802.16 provides classes of QoS deliveries but leaves the MAC layer scheduling to be vendor specific. An optimized scheduling algorithm is proposed in this paper using fuzzy logic. For the proposed algorithm to be network adaptive a preprocessing algorithm which predicts the effect of parameters is employed to adjust parameter values. A fuzzy inference system based on the parameters queue length, downlink rate, uplink rate, and blocking probability is formulated and used. The first Fuzzy Inference System uses the processed parameters as inputs to compute a goodness index. The second phase of fuzzy inferencing computes a final goodness metric which involves the goodness metric calculated and the QoS class to which the packet belongs to. The final goodness metric is used in optimal scheduling. The fairness of the algorithm is calculated and found to be better than that of the conventional algorithms.
